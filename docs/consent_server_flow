Server-Managed Consent Flow (AGB & Privacy)
This project assumes a server-first consent architecture.
Principles
Consent is enforced by the external User/Auth server.
EPTEC frontend is read-only regarding consent decisions.
Access is granted or revoked based on server flags.
Required Capabilities of the User Server
Versioned Terms & Privacy documents
Mandatory re-consent campaigns
Personalized confirmation links
Deadline handling (e.g. 30 days)
Automatic suspension or termination
Audit log (user id, timestamp, version)
Frontend Contract
EPTEC only consumes:
consent_required (bool)
consent_version_terms
consent_version_privacy
access_status (active / suspended / terminated)
